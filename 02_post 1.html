         <h1>Gender and the Tech Industry</h1>
        </br>
        <p><i>This blog post includes my thoughts on the article “Exploring the Gender Gap in Tech Companies:
            Why Aren't There More Women?” furthering the discussion around women and their role in technological innovation and the tech industry.</i></p>
        </br>
        <p><i>This article looks to answer the fascinating question, “Why is there such underrepresentation of women in tech?” Moreover, this article hopes to provide recommendations to organizations and universities to ultimately diversify the tech field.</i></p> 
        </br>
        <p>The homogeneity of the tech sector is well documented. The tech workforce is dominated by white men. This sameness is not a natural phenomenon but rather because of the presence of discriminatory hiring practices, misogyny in the workplace, and general societal barriers that discourage women from pursuing STEM degrees and job opportunities. Additionally, this problem recreates itself. With few women already in the field, finding a mentor or advocate can be difficult, making it even more challenging for women to envision and attain successful and fulfilling careers in the industry.</p>
    </br>
        <p>Though we have been aware of the gender gap in the tech industry for decades and there have been legislative interventions presented to address it, the gap persists (Miller et al., 2000). While most people know that tech jobs are male dominated the numbers are staggering. Women make up only 25% of tech workforce even though they are 51% of the general population (Chaudhry et al., 2019). And even though more and more women are graduating universities with degrees in STEM, women cite toxic workplaces and the absences of women role models in the industry as reason for leaving the field (White and Massiha, 2016). To further understand the gender gap, watch this video breaking down the statistics:</p>

        <p>Some people suggest that the gender gap in the tech industry is largely due to a lack of interest or competency in technology by women and while gender roles and societal expectations traditionally discourage women from an education in STEM, data suggests that women score as well and often even higher than their male counterparts in STEM courses (Chaudhry et al., 2019). Thus, the data does not support the argument that this gap is due to solely merit based hiring practices.</p>
    </br>
        <p>The gender gap in the tech industry is a complex issue with many contributing factors like discriminatory hiring practices, societal biases, and a general lack of support for women in the field, but after decades of research into this phenomenon we can comfortably say that the persistent underrepresentation of women in tech is not because of ineptitude but rather because of systemic barriers that need to be addressed with targeted efforts to encourage diversity in the tech sector.</p>
