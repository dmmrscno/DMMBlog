        <h1>Replacing Professors with AI </h1>
    </br>
        <p><i>This blog post includes my thoughts on the article “Universities May Soon Replace Professors with AI and Robots” advancing the dialog about what, if any, role artificial intelligence might play in higher education.</i></p>
    </br>
        <p><i>This article provides an in-depth analysis of the pros and potential cons of integrating AI into higher education using Jill Watson, a virtual teaching assistant created with artificial intelligence, as a prototype for what the integration of AI in courses could look like.</i></p>
    </br>
        <p>As AI and language learning models (LLMs) take the world by storm, we are just beginning to understand how they might affect society. When considering what role artificial intelligence might play in education there is a lot of excitement as well as a level of skepticism and concern. While concerns about inequity and overall effectiveness are healthy, as we will need to be careful in our implementation of it, ultimately, AI is to stay, and we need to consider how we can effectively incorporate it into higher education.</p>
    </br>
        <p>Though there are reasonable concerns about the implementation of artificial intelligence into higher education, the Jill Watson experiment demonstrates some of the benefits of incorporating AI teaching assistants into courses. Due to its capacity to answer multiple students simultaneously and at any time of day, Jill was able to assist students without the limitations of a traditional human teaching assistant (Schranger and Wang, 2017). Additionally, through personalized instruction materials centered around the idea of gamification education can be revolutionized (Taneri, 2020). Lastly, because human labor is a significant part of the cost of universities, education cost could theoretically drop with the introduction of AI.</p>
    </br>
        <p>For all the good artificial intelligence could do, it does have its challenges. As many of these LLMs are newer technology, they are not without their issues. Inherent biases and occasional propagation of misinformation makes these models far from perfect (Bobula, 2024). There is also something to be said about the significance of human-to-human interaction in education. As David Albouy suggests, “There is no substitute for face-to face interaction” (Schranger and Wang, 2017). Ultimately, it comes down to trust. Do we trust that AI can teach more effectively than a human? If not, than the monetary savings AI can offer may not be worth it.</p>
    </br>
        <p>Because AI is around to stay, it is not a question of if we implement it into higher education, it is a matter of how and when. This means using AI in the ways it can be effective, like personalized practice assessments, while also recognizing the ways in which it is limited. You will never do away with teachers entirely, or at least you should not, but finding ways to ease the burden of educators and students is always a noble cause.</p>
